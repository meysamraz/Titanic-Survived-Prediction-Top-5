# Titanic-Survived-Prediction-Top-5
Titanic  competition use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck . In this notebook, I tried to understand the relationship between variables and classify who survived and  who did not . with help of  (1 - data visualization  2 - feature Engineering  3 - model building )

## Overview 
### 1) Understand the data (Shape , missing values , data types , ...)

### 2) Data Visualization  (Histograms,box plots)

### 3) Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

### 4) Model Building

# Data Visualization 
In this part  I visualize the data to have a better understanding of the data using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
